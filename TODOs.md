## Some TODOs
    With a hope that this small project will someday achieve the form I have dreamed when I first created the file Skewuy.js

* Infer dimensions (frameWidth, frameGutter etc.) from the spritesheet provided, without the need of explicitly writing them as arguments in skewuy function. 
  
  This would probably remove restriction on  each image of the spritesheet being exactly 1920x1080 px

* Structure a cleaner logic, maybe someday (when I have plenty of time to rethink). Putting everything on the constructor of the Skewuy class still feels disaster to me
  
* (this is for developers/contributors) Make a decent build procedure so that with a single command both npm build and CDN build are generated automatically
